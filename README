Squarebot!

He's a campfire bot that tells you where your friends are when you ask him!

He's built with a plugin system so that you can make him do more things. (see lib/plugins/example.rb)

Getting started:
1) bootstrap:
gem install activesupport json yajl yaml

2) create your config.yml file in the project root (see config.yml.example)
3) ./script/run

Basic commands:

@squarebot where is frank? #firstname!
@squarebot where is DW #initials!

(@squarebot can also be the campfire Squarebot: syntax too)
